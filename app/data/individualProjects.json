The Baja platform is a rare and unconventional starting point, yet it offers a practical truck bed ideal for hauling tools and spare parts during the long road segments. Retaining the rear seats was a deliberate choice, allowing space for additional pit crew members—meaning more help when it counts and more fun along the way.",

This setup is capable of handling over 40 psi of boost from an S366 turbocharger, supplemented by a 100-horsepower shot of nitrous, producing approximately 800 horsepower on a Mustang dyno. Airflow is managed through a shaved 2.5 intake manifold and an air-to-water intercooler with an ice box, keeping intake temperatures under control for hard quarter-mile passes. For improved access and faster servicing, the radiator was relocated to the truck bed.",
